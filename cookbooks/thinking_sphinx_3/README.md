# Sphinx

This recipe is used to run Sphinx on the stable-v5 stack.

The thinking_sphinx_3 recipe is managed by Engine Yard. You should not copy this recipe to your repository but instead copy custom-thinking_sphinx_3. Please check the [custom-thinking_sphinx_3 readme](../../custom-cookbooks/thinking_sphinx_3/cookbooks/custom-thinking_sphinx)3) for the complete instructions.

This recipe requires that you use the thinking-sphinx gem version 3 or newer. If you're using thinking-sphinx 2 or ultrasphinx, you can convert the stable-v4 recipe https://github.com/engineyard/ey-cloud-recipes/tree/master/cookbooks/sphinx. We recommend that you upgrade the thinking-sphinx gem and use this recipe instead.

We accept contributions for changes that can be used by all customers.
